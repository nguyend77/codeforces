# Codeforces solution in Python 🐍
As I am preparing for my first ever attempt at the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), this repository contains my solutions to some CodeForces exercises. My goal is to solve at much problems as possible to familiarize myself with Competitive Programming and put my Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge from class into practice.
## About ICPC 🌐
[ICPC](https://icpc.global/) is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest for college students all over the world. Elmhurst University is sending our first ever team to compete at the 2025 North America Mid-Central Regional Qualification Round.
