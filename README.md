# Codeforces solution in Python
As I am preparing for my first ever attempt at the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), this repository contains my solutions to some CodeForces exercises. I am trying to solve at much problems as possible to familiarize myself with Competitive Programming and put my Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge from class into practice.
